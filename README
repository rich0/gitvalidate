Tools to be used to validate the Gentoo cvs->git migration.

Still could use a bit of refinement, but here is how to use these:
1.  Setup
   a. Install dependencies.  Includes dos2unix, pygit.
   b. Have lots of TMPDIR space - haven't measured but could easily be 10GB
      (merge sort between map and reduce - the rest is piped).
2.  For CVS, run cvsdump/cvsprocesstree.sh <path to gentoo-x86 in cvs root>
    <path to checkout of gentoo-x86>.  Be sure your checkout points to the root and
    not to gentoo's cvs server or you'll hammer it.
3.  For git, run gitdump/gitprocesstree.sh <path to git tree root> <head commit
    hash>.  Yes, I'm sure I can get rid of that hash.

Both scripts dump to stdout (eventually) in csv format - you'll want to redirect
to a file.  Output is 1 line per commit per file.  Ideally all the lines would
correspond, but with the commit squashing/etc it doesn't work out quite that
way.  I've been loading into mysql and running queries.  Note that
message/author is in base64 to simplify file format (no line breaks).

This will parallelize to however many cpus you have - it runs near 100% on all
of them most of the time (except when sort is catching up).  RAM use is pretty
light - sort probably uses most of it unless you have a LOT of cpus - everything
else is piped and doesn't queue up much, and sort does an on-disk merge.

I have things tuned for 4 cpus right now.  The cvs scripts have some options
around how you parallelize it.  Logparse and cvscalchash do not care about line
order, so you can pipe those two together as a unit and run that in parallel, or
run each independently in parallel.  I suspect depending on hardware details
they might vary in relative speed - this is what gave the highest CPU load in my
tests.
